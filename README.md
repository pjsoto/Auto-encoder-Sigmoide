# CycleGAN-based Domain Adaptation for Deforestation Detection.

The overall architecture of the proposed methodology. As in CycleGAN framework, the model contains two mappingfunctionsand as well as the associated discriminators and. encourages the to translate into outcomes indistinguishable of , and vice versa for and .  To further regularizes the translation procedure, weintroduced twodifference losseswhich aim at preserving the changes between the images of both domains in their respectivetranslated versions. Although not represented, the model also uses the already knowncycle consistency lossand theidentity lossdefined in [1].
